RIFF    WAVEfmt                 D  data    This is a fake WAV file for testing the MP3 Rewind file system implementation. It contains the RIFF header that your audio detection code looks for, followed by some dummy data to simulate a real audio file. The file is long enough to test seeking operations and file reading functionality.

This content simulates what would be in a real WAV file, allowing you to test:
- File opening and closing
- Reading file headers
- Audio file format detection
- File size calculations
- Seek operations to different positions in the file

The fake WAV file continues with more content to make it substantial enough for thorough testing of your file system wrapper implementation.
