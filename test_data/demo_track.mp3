ID3     TIT2      Test MP3 Song TPE1      Test Artist TALB      Test Album TYER      2025   This is a simulated MP3 file for testing the file system. It starts with ID3 metadata header that your code should detect as an MP3 file.

The content here simulates MP3 audio data and metadata. This allows testing of:
- MP3 file format detection via ID3 header
- File operations like open, read, seek, close
- Audio file scanning and listing functionality
- File size and position tracking

This fake MP3 file provides enough content to test seeking to different positions and reading chunks of data, just like a real MP3 file would during audio playback.
