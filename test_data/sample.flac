fLaCThis is a simulated FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) file for testing purposes. The file begins with the characteristic "fLaC" signature that your audio detection code should recognize.

FLAC files are lossless audio compression format, and this simulation allows testing of:
- FLAC file format detection via the fLaC header
- File system operations on different audio file types
- Audio file scanning across multiple formats
- File reading and seeking operations

The simulated FLAC content continues here to provide enough data for comprehensive file system testing, including operations that seek to different positions within the file and read various chunk sizes.
